Important Distributions Knowlege 1 (Geometric Distribution) If $X$ conforms to geometric distribution with parameter $p$, then $X$ counts the number of trials unitl the first sucess in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with probability $p$, the probability distribution of $X$ is \\(\\mathbb{P}(X=n)=(1-p)^{n-1}p,\\quad n=1, 2, \\cdots\\) Then $X$ has the property that \\[\\mathbb{E}(X)=\\frac{1}{p}, \\text{Var}(X)=\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\] An intuitive way to understand the expectation of $X$ is, Each trial succeeds with prob $p$ On average, among $n$ trials you expect $np$ successes To get 1 success, you need $n=1/p$ trials on average Knowlege 2. Important Calculus Knowlege 2-1 \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\\sqrt{\\pi}\\] Comment Notice that this is exactly $\\Gamma(1/2)$ in Knowlege 2-3 (Gamma Function) Related to the probability density function of normal distribution Knowlege 2-2 (Beta Function) Beta function $B(x,y)$ is defined as \\[B(x,y)=\\int_0^1t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1}dt\\] where $x&gt;0$ and $y &gt; 0$. It has the properties like \\[B(x,y)=B(y,x)\\] \\[B(x,y+1)=\\frac{y}{x+y}B(x,y)\\] Knowlege 2-3 (Gamma Function) Gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$ is defined as \\[\\Gamma(z)=\\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\\] where $z&gt;0$. It has properties like \\[\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z),\\quad \\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!\\text{ if }n\\in\\mathbb{N}^+\\] \\[\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z)=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}\\text{ where }x\\notin\\mathbb{N},\\quad \\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2})=\\sqrt{\\pi}\\] \\[B(x,y)=\\frac{\\Gamma(x)\\Gamma(y)}{\\Gamma(x+y)}\\] Comment Notice that $\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2})=\\sqrt{\\pi}$ is exactly $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}e^{-x^2}dx$ in Knowlege 2-1"
